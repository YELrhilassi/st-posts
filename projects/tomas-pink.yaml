fullDescription: >
  A comprehensive brand refresh and digital experience redesign for the luxury clothing brand Thomas Pink. The project involved creating a new visual identity that honored the brand's heritage while modernizing its appeal for today's consumers.
challenge: >
  Thomas Pink needed to reconnect with its core audience while attracting younger customers. The brand had strong heritage elements but lacked digital presence and modern appeal.
solution: >
  We developed a refined visual language that maintained the brand's signature pink while introducing a more contemporary typography system and photography style. The digital experience was completely reimagined with a focus on storytelling and product discovery.
results: >
  The rebrand resulted in a 45% increase in online engagement and a 30% boost in e-commerce sales within the first quarter after launch. The new identity received industry recognition, including a nomination for Best Brand Refresh at the Design Awards.
